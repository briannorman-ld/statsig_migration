/**
 * How completely a StatSig construct reaches LaunchDarkly through the console.
 *
 * - `migrates`   Translated exactly, automatically. At most informational notes.
 * - `decisions`  Migrates, but at least one aspect needs a Decision (PLAN §8) or is acknowledged
 *                as partial fidelity. Nothing is dropped silently.
 * - `guided`     No automatic write. The console produces a checklist, a generated document or
 *                step-by-step guidance; a person finishes it in LD or in code.
 * - `planned`    An LD equivalent exists and the mapping is specified, but the console doesn't
 *                write it yet. The item is inventoried and its blockers are listed.
 * - `none`       LaunchDarkly has no equivalent. StatSig-only, or replaced by a different LD
 *                product. Called out so nobody expects it.
